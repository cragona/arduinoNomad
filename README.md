Nomad hackathon 2021

Press the A button on the LED Screen to continue.

Update arduino_secrets.h with the wifi before building.

Just drag and drop the folders from libraries into your own libraries folder.

If you still have trouble building make sure you have all the libraries by matching the library names with the header names in the sketch.

You will need to get the following libraries through the Library Manager or the libraries folder in the IDE:
* WiFi101
* SPI
* Adafruit_GPS
* timestamp32bits
* sps30
* DHT
* Wire
* Adafruit_GFX
* Adafruit_SSD1306
